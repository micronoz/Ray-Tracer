# Ray-Tracer
This is a full ray tracer engine that can trace ray-object intersections to render scenes that are made up of triangles and spheres. Lighting and scene contents are fully customizable using the file format as seen in the samples folder.

The 'make sub' command will compile and execute the raytracer on the test scenes provided in the samples folder. FreeImage C++ packages should be installed. The loops will execute in parallel meaning the CPU will be fully utilized during execution.
