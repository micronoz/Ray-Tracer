# Ray-Tracer
This is a full ray tracer engine that can trace ray-object intersections to render scenes that are made up of triangles and spheres. Lighting and scene contents are fully customizable using the file format as seen in the sample-scenes folder.

The 'make sub' command will compile and execute the raytracer on the test scenes provided in the sample-scenes folder. FreeImage C++ packages should be installed. The loops will execute in parallel meaning the CPU will be fully utilized during execution.

Requirements:
Run command 'sudo apt-get install libfreeimage3 libfreeimage-dev' to install the free image library.
